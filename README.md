## üîß Refactored Features

### 1. üèÜ Win Condition & Deuce Rule
- The game now ends when a player scores **5 points**.
- If both players reach **4:4**, the game enters **deuce** mode:
  - A player must lead by at least **2 points** to win.

### 2. Player Roles Fixed
- **Player 1** (left Pikachu) is the **booth participant**.
- **Player 2** (right Pikachu) is a **Greedy member**.
- The roles are now fixed for consistent gameplay at events.

### 3. Updated Controls

| Player | Direction | Key |
|--------|-----------|-----|
| Player 1 (participant) | Move Left  | `ArrowLeft` |
|                  | Move Right | `ArrowRight` |
|                  | Jump       | `ArrowUp` |
|                  | Down       | `ArrowDown` |
|                  | Power Hit  | `Z` |
| Player 2 (Greedy) | Move Left  | `K` |
|                  | Move Right | `Semi-Colon(;)` |
|                  | Jump       | `O` |
|                  | Down       | `L` |
|                  | Power Hit  | `F` |

### 4. Score Calculation Logic

- üî¥ Lose **before deuce** ‚Üí actual score (`0` to `winningScore - 2`)
- üü¢ Win **after deuce** ‚Üí `6 points` (`winningScore + 1`)
- üî¥ Lose **after deuce** ‚Üí `5 points` (`winningScore`)

- ‚ûïŒ± Skill Score (0.00 to 12.00 points)
  > Skill Score calculated through internal score aggregation logic.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Localhost:8080 remains active even after stopping the server?

Even after stopping the local development server with `Ctrl + C`, the browser may continue to show the previous version of the app or keep intercepting requests to `localhost:8080`.

This happens because the **Service Worker** and cached data are still active in your browser.

### ‚úÖ Solution 1: Clear site data (recommended to try first)
1. Open Chrome DevTools (`F12` or `Cmd + Option + I`)
2. Go to the **Application** tab
3. In the sidebar, select **Storage**
4. Under **Site data**, check all the boxes (including `Local storage`, `Cookies`, `Cache storage`, etc.)
5. Click the **Clear site data** button

6. Refresh the page

This often resolves the issue without needing to unregister the service worker.

### ‚úÖ Solution 2: Unregister the Service Worker
If the above method does not work:

1. Open Chrome DevTools (`F12` or `Cmd + Option + I`)
2. Navigate to the **Application** tab
3. In the sidebar, click **Service Workers**
4. click **See all registrations**

5. Look for the Service Worker registered for `localhost:8080`
6. Click **Unregister**
